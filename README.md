## Course Description ##
In this bootcamp, you will learn the fundamentals of web development with C# (pronounced C sharp) and Microsoftâ€™s .NET Core Framework. The goal is get you familiar enough with the core-language and technical tools to work towards a Microsoft Technology Associate (MTA) Certification. Entry level .NET developers are in high demand in New Mexico. Participants who take this program will increase their skill set to work with companies who utilize these systems. There are three, primary coding deliverables:
* Logic and problem solving exercises
* Personal Resume Website to market your new skills
* Capstone Project (large web application created by teams of 3-4)

## Student Learning Outcomes ##
Upon successful completion of the course, the participant will be able to:
1. Implement industry proven problem solving techniques
2. Learn C#, MVC, some HTML, some CSS, and some JavaScript to become a full stack web developer
3. Create a personal online resume to market yourself as a web developer
4. Build a web application as a team

## Hardware & Software Requirements ##
One of the following operating systems:
* Windows: Windows 8.1 or above

## Class Etiqutte ##
Every person in the class has the same requirements. It is very important to recognize that some might be slower or faster than others. It is critical that you keep up with the work that is happening on the screen. Typing the code into your IDE has to be done with care and at a reasonable pace. When you are behind the pace of the class the entire class slows down. There are many different strategies to keep up with the pace of class. The one that appears to be the most beneficial is to watch while the presenter types, listen while the presenter explains what was typed and then work on your version. An inability to maintain the classroom speed will be noted by intstructors and attempts will be made to assist. If the pace of the class continues to be negatively affected further discusions with the instructor team and student will be made.

## Ask Good Questions ##
Asking questions is critical in software development. Software developers are constantly under stress and realize that being a good team player is sharing the burden. Because of this stress, we will research questions that are vital. The strategy you are required to use is:
1. Read the documentation, code examples, Google searches, etc for at least 20 minutes.
2. Ask your peers.
3. Ask your instructors.

This process will engage you in the problem on a deep level and form good habits required in the software development world.

## Evaluation ##
The class will be evaluated in three categories:
1. Capstone: 50% - Team project 
	1. Must consume a public API
	2. Must be a multiple page application
	3. Mastery of the topics 
2. Personal Resume Site: 30%
	1. Authentication implemented
	2. Data Seeded
	3. Single Page resume view
	4. Appropriate style
3. Assessments: 20%
	1. Assigned Tasks through Classroom
		1. The number of assigned tasks can vary based on the class. The tasks will be assigned through Slack and delivered throug the classroom
		2. Failure to complete 3 tasks on time and or with poor code quality is basis for removal from the class. It is important to do the assigned work so that when you are in class you have performed the tasks successfully that we are building on in class. 
	2. Complete all the assessments at [Microsoft Virtual Academy - Software Development Fundamentals](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-us/training-courses/software-development-fundamentals-8248?l=Ch3UiAY6C_7905190311)

## Course Mastery ##
It is important that the student show mastery of the topics presented in the class on their individual/team projects with out reliance on the fellow students, teaching assistant or instructor. Mastery of the topic is demonstrated through successful completion of the task without assistance, if assistance is required being able to answer the questions being asked during the coaching and being able to apply the assistance to the other areas of the application as required. Mastery is not being able to copy and paste code that was given into multiple locations and hoping that the code works.

It is up to the student to test the work that they turn in. If the code is not working, then it is the responsibility of the student to get assistance until it works. The instructor team is not to be used as a tester of the application.
